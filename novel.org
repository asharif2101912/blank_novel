* The beginning
It was Sunday, just a regular Sunday. Or so it had seemed. Sunday was her birthday, the day she was born. She had just been taken home from the
hospital, sleeping in the crimson blanket they gave her. Mrs.Tian had brought her into the house, and held her rocking in her chair. "She's so 
beautiful, I wonder what I should name her..." she whispered, her voice trailing off. "it's hot!" Mrs.Tian exclaimed, "I'm gonna' have to take
that blanket off you"  

* What?
